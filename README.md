## <font color="steelblue">Research Profile</font>


I am a mathematician and an artificial intelligence researcher. I have a Ph.D. in mathematics from Isfahan University of Technology, where I studied finite group theory. I also have a master's degree in mathematics from Tarbiat Modares University, where I worked on the chemical graph theory and Wiener index of graphs. I have been selected as an elite student by the National Elites Foundation of Iran and collaborated with researchers at the University of Florence.

I am interested in applying mathematics to solve challenges in research areas related to real-world applications. I have worked on various projects in Computer Vision, NLP, and Graph Neural Network. Recently, I finished the investigation of pruning and quantization impact on graph neural networks. Pruning is a technique to reduce the complexity and improve the efficiency of neural networks by removing unnecessary parameters or connections.
